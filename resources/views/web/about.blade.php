                    <p>Tekumatics Homemanager is the management app that helps the landlord/real estate agent or
                        property owners/renters to manage the home, collect the rent, remind/enforce the occupants to
                        take part in their household duties/policies, provide an effective platform that enhances the
                        friendly home, communications amongst households and the landlord and home affairs, etc.
                        Apart from just turning up to collect the rent, it is very hard to manage the overall aspect of
                        the house/property for rent by the landlord. So many Landlords who have people in their house
                        for rent face challenges trying to make sure their property is well managed and looked after.
                        Arguments between the tenants, late or untimely rent payment, lack of communication between the
                        landlord and tenant, etc. are some of those areas challenging for the landlord. Especially for
                        those shared houses (Renting rooms), it is even more bizarre. Hence Tekumatics Homemanager App
                        is designed to work on those areas and help the landlord manage its property well and
                        efficiently. Tekumatics Homemanager App takes over the landlord's management tasks and allows a
                        landlord to save time, effort, money, and increase its profitability.
                        Tekumatics Homemanager app is a customized solution property manager app- designed and developed
                        based on research and personal experience living in several years in shared accommodations.
                        Living in a shared house/accommodation is sometimes worse given the people with different ways
                        of living and doing things. In a multicultural home of tenants with different backgrounds, ways
                        of living, lifestyle, financial scenarios, etc. it is very very tough for landlords to manage
                        and make sure a responsible, friendly, and peaceful home atmosphere is maintained. It is also
                        the Landlord’s responsibility to make sure there is a peaceful friendly environment at home;
                        Landlord must make sure, every tenant take part in their household duties, improve and provide
                        an easy communication platform between landlord, tenants, and amongst the tenants themselves,
                        make sure and maintained friendly, peaceful home environment, etc.
                        “I can remember living in a shared house at one stage where all of us were students. Most of the
                        tenants were all international students and we had different days of receiving our allowances
                        and had to pay rents on different days which was causing inconvenience and a lot of work for the
                        Landlord. Many times the landlord mixes up the rent due dates and look bad calling rent for some
                        early/after.
                        Most of the time in a shared house, household duties are never equally shared. A particular
                        tenant would be the one only cleaning the house, taking the rubbish out, etc while some are too
                        lazy, busy, or just never seem to be doing. One tenant telling the other tenant what to do in a
                        house is disrespectful. Even though the Landlord can have a roaster of who is cleaning the
                        shower room, toilet, taking the rubbish out, etc. but enforcing it is always a problem. Some
                        tenants never do their duty as they forget, busy, or maybe lazy. Tekumatics Homemanager app has
                        a feather that allows the landlord to assign household duties to every tenant. The landlord will
                        need to at least spend 10 minutes creating a roaster on this app. The app then will send an
                        automatic alert message to the tenants on a day or a day or two before.

                        Most landlords are usually busy when they have full-time jobs, other properties to deal with at
                        the same time, they live far, etc. which causes them to have no time sometimes to collect rents
                        on time. To solve those problems, MyPro App technology provides a very prudent platform that
                        helps the landlord to manage their property. This app automates every aspect of managing their
                        property from the signing in of new tenants into a home, reminding them of their household
                        duties, collecting their rent, keeping records, and notify when to pay next; improves and
                        provide a very efficient communication platform between the household community including the
                        landlord itself.
                        This app was built to manage a shared house (renting out the rooms). It can also be very
                        beneficial to real estate agents to manage the properties. Some of the technical features of
                        this app like collecting the rent and keeping the record (of due dates etc) and mini financial
                        statement, can be very helpful. This app has a function to make a video, voice record, write
                        notes, etc which can be of great use especially during the inspection of the property. It can be
                        a very good communication platform between the tenant and the real estate agent. For instance,
                        if a gas leak or toilet is blocked, the tenant can make a video and post it to the real estate
                        agent via this app which saves time and makes it easier to communicate and understand the
                        problem. The real estate agent can set up calendars/reminder alerts will be sent. If an update
                        or announcement needs to be made, the real estate agent can send out a message to its customers
                        via this app. Property contractual agreements can be printed or signed online via this app and
                        this app can manage many properties at the same time. The external service providers like
                        plumbers, electricians, etc are linked up and can be reached via this app.

                    <h3 class="text-center">Functionality</h3>
                    <h4>App description/functionality</h4>
                    <p>There are two versions of the app, they are the Landlord version which can also be used by Real
                        Estate Agent, and the tenant versions.
                        The Landlord installs the landlord version and creates his/her profile. Then As part of the
                        contract/agreement, the Landlord has to send the link and tell the tenants to install this app
                        on their phone. The Landlord version is pretty much an admin version which the admin installs on
                        its phone and sends the link to the tenants to download their tenant version of the app. The
                        Landlord will need to spend about 20 minutes going through the app filling the information and
                        can prefill or leave blank for the tenants which tenants themselves could complete via the
                        tenant version of the app. Dates when the tenant first moved in and then the next rent due date
                        (how many days later) etc. are some of the information. Whatever days/week the landlord assigns,
                        the app will automatically send the reminder alerts a day or two in advance. The app will follow
                        up and collect the rent, keep records, and tell both landlord and tenants when the next rent is
                        due. The App will automatically collect the rent online. The App will then make a record and
                        generate a mini financial statement of how much being collected, spent if any, the time when it
                        is collected, how much balance, etc.
                        The Landlord will also assign the rooster. Assign every tenant with household duties like who is
                        cleaning the shower room, who is cleaning the toilet, taking the rubbish out, etc. The landlord
                        via the Landlord version can assign and make a roaster which the app will automatically act on
                        it and send alerts and a reminder when approaching the date.
                        The app has a community noticeboard. This feature provides a platform for all the house
                        occupants to discuss concerns, issues, agendas, etc. concerning the house or anything amongst
                        them. For example like if the toilet is blocked or, washing machine not working, etc. will be
                        needed to be discussed by everyone. The app can take videos/photos. If the Toilet is a block or
                        the washing machine is not working etc. any tenants can make a video/photo and post it directly
                        to the landlord or the community discussion board. The landlord does not need to drive all the
                        way to see what's going on, instead, the video/photos can be okay for him to know what's going
                        on. The app has a link of an external- nearby service providers provider like plumber,
                        electricians, etc., or even their preferred service providers. The Landlord can forward the
                        video/photo plus the description to the plumber or their preferred plumbers just via the app.
                        Every property management task will be automated and the app will continue to routinely execute
                        the tasks. The Landlord doesn’t need to tell its tenants what to do like household duties etc,
                        instead, the app will routinely do that. Once programmed by filling out space via the Landlord
                        version, the app will continue to communicate and manage the home affair on behalf of the
                        landlord. The app will collect and keep records of rents on behalf of the landlord, the app will
                        maintain the household community relationship amongst the tenants and the landlord; the app will
                        improve the communication level, foster understanding and agreeing home responsibilities, etc.
                        The App will automatically do everything for the Landlord </p>

                            We have two versions of the app. The landlord and the tenant versions.

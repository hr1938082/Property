                            <p>Our app has a feature that allows for household/community discussion openly or can be
                                done privately between tenant to tenant or tenant-landlord. Our app has a provision also
                                for video conferencing/meeting, voice record, etc. Any issues concerning households that
                                need everyone's participation or holding an important meeting, alerts, discussions can
                                be done virtually or through the community discussion notice board. The app has a

                                blockage, washing machine malfunctioning, etc. can be videoed or taken photos and post
                                it to the community discussion board or directly to the landlord. The app has a database
                                of nearby service providers like plumbers and electricians which can easily be contacted
                                via the app. The landlord/real estate agent can pretty much manage everything via the
                                app remotely without going to the property. </p>

                            <h5>Solves issues and Provides a peaceful friendly home</h5>
                            <p>Our app promotes communication and understanding amongst the tenants. Our app acts as a
                                home mother and assigns and enforces every tenant to participate in household duties
                                etc. For example, if the app asks Peter to take the Rubbish out and, John to clean the
                                kitchen, etc. ......... The landlord has to create the weekly roaster via the landlord
                                profile and the app keeps carrying out the alerts and reminders and enforces them. </p>

                                etc. For example, if the app asks Peter to take the Rubbish out and, John to clean the

                        <li>
                            <h5>Home Inspection</h5>
                            <p>The landlord or the real estate agent can virtually carry out home inspection via the
                                Tekumatics app. Tekumatics app has a provision to make photos, videos and voice-records
                                which can be used to make videos and photos by the tenants to send to the property
                                owner/landlord/real estate agent. Covid has changed the way we do ordinary things and
                                home inspection is no different. Tekumatics can make it easier, safer and quicker for
                                you. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Property Maintenance </h5>
                            <p>For an example, Imagine if a pipe of your property is block and tenants in that shared
                                house/property tells you the problem. Tekumatics can do that work and make it
                                easier for you. Any tenants can use Tekumatics to make a quick video or take photos of
                                the problem and flip it over via the Tekumatics app and you receive in real time. You
                                are busy or live far to drive down for an inspection and verify the problem. You
                                understand, know what is going on and you are ahead of the problem. If you need a
                                plumber, you can contact the service provider around the area. Tekumatics can bring up
                                the external property maintenance service provider and make it easy for you too.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Household community board </h5>
                            <p>Tekumatics home Manager app has a feature called community notice board which is very
                                important and provide good platform for the household to discuss issues etc. Landlord
                                can also participate. It can be done through the Tekumatics community notice board
                                features. For example; if someone left food on the kitchen for days or rotten meat in a
                                freeze or if someone that meant to vacuum the house didn’t, the issue can be raise to
                                discuss on the notice board anonymously. Sometimes it becomes personal trying to tell
                                another tenant what to do. The community notice board is a way of enhancing and
                                improving the friendly household communication that benefits everyone. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Landlord/tenants meetings</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes there is a need for the property owner or the landlord to hold a meeting with
                                the tenants to talk about certain issues of the house. Due to the covid 19, or factors
                                like landlord being busy or live far, it becomes inconvenient. Hence, Tekumatics can
                                provide the platform where household meetings can be virtually done. All can virtually
                                participate through video group calls via Tekumatics or they can hold group discussion
                                via community notice board features of the app from the convenience of where they are.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Enhances communication between Landlords/ real estate agents and tenants</h5>
                            <p>Why wasting too much time messaging all the tenants individually? It can be done one-go
                                via the Tekumatics home manager app and can be automated. Through the landlord verson of
                                the app, the landlord or real estate agent or parents if family is using this, can
                                choose the reminder to be sent whether weekly, forth nightly etc. Landlord can automate
                                and the app will take over and send reminder/alerts when the time approaches with out
                                the landlord making effort. The household duties, rent collections date reminders etc.
                                Tekumatics enhances, improves and promotes communication which is very fundamental to
                                have peaceful and friendly home.
